<h2>
    PREFACE
</h2>

<p>
The contents of the present volume are of much the same character as
those of its predecessor, 'Roman Britain in 1913'. The first section
gives a retrospect of the chief finds made in 1914, so far as they are
known to me. The second section is a more detailed and technical survey
of the inscriptions found in Britain during that year. The third and
longest section is a summary, with some attempt at estimate and
criticism, of books and articles dealing with Roman Britain which
appeared in 1914 or at least bear that date on cover or title-page.
At the end I have added, for convenience, a list of the English
archaeological and other publications which at least sometimes contain
noteworthy articles relating to Roman Britain.
</p>
<p>
The total, both of finds and of publications, is smaller than in 1913.
In part the outbreak of war in August called off various supervisors
and not a few workmen from excavations then in progress; in one case
it prevented a proposed excavation from being begun. It also seems to
have retarded the issue of some archaeological periodicals. But the
scarcity of finds is much more due to natural causes. The most extensive
excavations of the year, those of Wroxeter and Corbridge, yielded
little; they were both concerned with remains which had to be explored
in the course of a complete uncovering of those sites but which were not
in themselves very interesting. The lesser sites, too, were somewhat
unproductive, though at least one, Traprain Law, is full of promise for
the future, and good work has been done in the systematic examination
of the fort at Ambleside and of certain rubbish-pits in London. In one
case, that of Holt (<a href="#page15">pp. 15-21</a>), where excavations have for the present
come to an end, I have thought it well to include a brief retrospect
of the whole of a very interesting series of finds and, aided by the
kindness of the excavator, Mr. Arthur Acton of Wrexham, to add some
illustrations of notable objects which have not yet appeared elsewhere
in print.

<h2>
    A. RETROSPECT OF FINDS MADE IN 1914
</h2>
<h3>
    i-xiv. <span class="sc">Finds relating to the Roman Military Occupation</span>.
</h3>
<p>
(i) The exploration of the Roman-seeming earthworks in northern Scotland
which Dr. Macdonald and I began in 1913 at Ythan Wells, in Aberdeenshire
(Report for 1913, p. 7), was continued in 1914 by Dr. Macdonald at
Raedykes, otherwise called Garrison Hill, three miles inland from
Stonehaven. Here Roy saw and planned a large camp of very irregular
outline, which he took to be Roman.<a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> Since his time the ramparts have
been somewhat ploughed down, but Dr. Macdonald could trace them round,
identify the six gateways, and generally confirm Roy's plan, apart from
its hill-shading. The ramparts proved to be of two kinds: part was built
solidly of earth, with a deep ditch of Roman shape strengthened in
places with clay, in front of it, while part was roughly piled with
stones and defended only by a shallow rounded ditch. This difference
seemed due to the differing nature of the ground; ditch and rampart were
slighter where attack was less easy. The gateways were wide and provided
with traverses (<i>tituli</i> or <i>tutuli</i>), as at Ythan Wells. No
small finds were secured. The general character of the gateways and
ramparts seemed to show Roman workmanship, but the exact date within the
Roman period remained doubtful. It has been suggested that the traverses
indicate Flavian rather than Antonine fortifying. But these devices are
met with in Britain at Bar Hill, which presumably dates from about A.D.
140, and on Hadrian's Wall in third-century work.
</p>
<p>
(ii) <i>Wall of Pius and its forts.</i> At Balmuildy, north of Glasgow
(see Report for 1913, p. 10), Mr. Miller has further cleared the baths
outside the south-east corner of the fort and the adjacent ditches. The
plan which I gave last year has now to be corrected so as to show a
triple ditch between the south gate and the south-east corner and a
double ditch from the south-east corner to the east gate. This latter

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span>

  section of ditch was, however, filled up at some time with clay, and the
bath planted on top of it. At presumably the same time a ditch was run
out from the south-east corner so as to enclose the bath and form an
annexe; in this annexe was found a broken altar-top with a few letters
on it (below, <a href="#page29">p. 29</a>). Search was also made for rubbish-pits on the north
side of the fort, but without any result.
</p>
<p>
On other parts of the Wall Dr. Macdonald has gained further successes.
Evidence seems to be coming out as to the hitherto missing forts of
Kirkintilloch and Inveravon. More details have been secured of the fort
at Mumrills&mdash;fully 4-1/2 acres in area and walled with earth, not with
the turf or stone employed in the ramparts of the other forts of the
Wall. The line of the Wall from Falkirk to Inveravon, a distance of four
miles, has also been traced; it proved to be built of earth and clay,
not of the turf used in the Wall westwards. Dr. Macdonald suggests that
the eastern section of the Wall lay through heavily wooded country,
where turf was naturally awanting.
</p>
<p>
(iii) <i>Traprain Law.</i> Very interesting, too, are the preliminary
results secured by Mr. A. O. Curie on Traprain Law. This is an isolated
hill in Haddingtonshire, some twenty miles east of Edinburgh, on the
Whittingehame estate of Mr. Arthur Balfour. Legends cluster round it&mdash;of
varying antiquity. It itself shows two distinct lines of fortification,
one probably much older than the other, enclosing some 60 acres. The
area excavated in 1914 was a tiny piece, about 30 yards square; the
results were most promising. Five levels of stratification could be
distinguished. The lowest and earliest yielded small objects of native
work and Roman potsherds of the late first century: higher up, Roman
coins and pottery of the second century appeared, and in the top level,
Roman potsherds assigned to the fourth century. One Roman potsherd, from
a second-century level, bore three Roman letters <span class="ss">IRI</span>, the meaning of
which is likely to remain obscure. As the inscribed surface came from
the inside of an urn, the writing must have been done after the pot was
broken, and presumably on the hill itself. Among the native finds were
stone and clay moulds for casting metal objects. The site, on a whole,
seems to be native rather than Roman; it may be our first clue to the
character of native <i>oppida</i> in northern Britain under Roman rule;
its excavation is eminently worth pursuing.
</p>
<p>
(iv) <i>Northumberland, Hadrian's Wall.</i> On Hadrian's Wall no
excavations have been carried out. But at Chesterholm two inscribed
altars were found in the summer. One was dedicated to Juppiter Optimus
Maximus; the rest of the lettering was illegible. The other, dedicated
to Vulcan on behalf of the Divinity of the Imperial

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span>

  House by the people of the locality, possesses much interest. The
dedicators describe themselves as <i>vicani Vindolandenses</i>, and thus
give proof that the civilians living outside the fort at Chesterholm
formed a <i>vicus</i> or something that could plausibly be described as
such; further, they teach the proper name of the place, which we have
been wont to call Vindolana. See further below, <a href="#page31">p. 31</a>.
</p>
<p>
North of the Wall, at Featherwood near High Rochester (the fort
Bremenium) an altar has been found, dedicated to Victory (see <a href="#page30">p. 30</a>).
</p>
<p>
(v) <i>Corbridge.</i> The exploration of Corbridge was carried through
its ninth season by Mr. R. H. Forster. As in 1913, the results were
somewhat scanty. The area examined, which lay on the north-east of the
site, adjacent to the areas examined in 1910 and 1913, seems, like them,
to have been thinly occupied in Roman times; at any rate the structures
actually unearthed consisted only of a roughly built foundation (25 feet
diam.) of uncertain use, which there is no reason to call a temple, some
other even more indeterminate foundations, and two bits of road. More
interest may attach to three ditches (one for sewage) and the clay base
of a rampart, which belong in some way to the northern defences of the
place in various times. The full meaning of these will, however, not be
discernible till complete plans are available and probably not till
further excavations have been made; Mr. Forster inclines to explain
parts of them as ditches of a fort held in the age of Trajan, about
A.D. 90-110. Several small finds merit note. An inscribed tile
seems to have served as a writing lesson or rather, perhaps, as a
reading lesson: see below, <a href="#page32">p. 32</a>. The Samian pottery included a very few
pieces of '29', a good deal of early '37', which most archaeologists
would ascribe to the late first or the opening second century, and some
other pieces which perhaps belong to a rather later part of the same
century. The coins cover much the same period; few are later than
Hadrian. Among them was a hoard of 32 denarii and 12 copper of which
Mr. Craster has made the following list:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="quote">
<i>Silver</i>: 2 Republican, 1 Julius Caesar, 1 Mark Antony, 1 Nero,
1 Galba, 3 Vitellius, 13 Vespasian, 3 Titus, 6 Domitian,
1 unidentified.
</p>
<p class="quote">
<i>Copper</i>: 3 Vespasian, 1 Titus, 2 Domitian, 3 Nerva, 1 Trajan,
2 unidentified.
</p>
<p>
The latest coin was the copper of Trajan&mdash;a <i>dupondius</i> or Second
Brass of A.D. 98. All the coins had been corroded into a single
mass, apparently by the burning of a wooden box in which they have been
kept; this burning must have occurred about A.D. 98-100. Among
the bronze objects found during the year was a dragonesque enamelled
brooch.

bronze-worker Cipius Polybius, and an uninscribed bronze ladle. See
below, <a href="#page33">p. 33</a>.
</p>
<p>
(vii) Near Appleby, at Hangingshaw farm, Mr. P. Ross has come upon a
Roman inscription which proves to be a milestone of the Emperor Philip
(A.D. 244-6) first found in 1694 and since lost sight of (<a href="#page35">p. 35</a>).
</p>
<p>
(viii) <i>Ambleside Fort.</i> The excavation of the Roman fort in
Borrans Field near Ambleside, noted in my Report for 1913 (p. 13), was
continued by Mr. R. G. Collingwood, Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford,
and others with much success. The examination of the ramparts, gates,
and turrets was completed; that of the main interior buildings was
brought near completion, and a beginning was made on the barracks,
sufficient to show that they were, at least in part, made of wood.

</div>

<p>
The fort, as is now clear (fig. 2), was an oblong enclosure of about 300
× 420 feet, nearly 3 acres. Round it ran a wall of roughly coursed stone
4 feet thick, with a clay ramp behind and a ditch in front. Turrets
stood at its corners. Four gates gave access to it; three of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[11]</span>

them were single and narrow, while the fourth, the east gate, was double
and was flanked by two guard-chambers. As usual, the chief buildings
stood in a row across the interior. Building I&mdash;see plan, fig. 2&mdash;was a
pair of granaries, each 66 feet long, with a space between. They were of
normal plan, with external buttresses, basement walls, and ventilating
windows (not shown on plan). The space between them, 15 feet wide,
contained marks of an oven or ovens (plan, B) and also some corn (plan,
C) and may have been at one time used for drying grain stored in the
granaries; how far it was roofed is doubtful. Building II, the Principia
or Praetorium, a structure of 68 × 76 feet, much resembled the Principia
at Hardknot, ten miles west of Ambleside, but possessed distinct
features. As the plan shows, it had an entrance from the east, the two
usual courts (EF), and the offices which usually face on to the inner
court F. These offices, however, were only three in number instead of
five, unless wooden partitions were used. Under the central office, the
<i>sacellum</i> of the fort, where the standards and the altars for the
official worship of the garrison are thought to have been kept, our fort
had, at A, a sunk room or cellar, 6 feet square, entered by a stone
stair. Such cellars occur at Chesters, Aesica, and elsewhere and
probably served as strong-rooms for the regimental funds. At Chesters,
the cellar had stone vaulting; at Ambleside there is no sign of this,
and timber may have been used. In the northernmost room of the Principia
some corn and woodwork as of a bin were noted (plan, C). The inner court
F seemed to Mr. Collingwood to have been roofed; in its north end was a
detached room, such as occurs at Chesters, of unknown use, which accords
rather ill with a roof. In the colonnade round the outer court E were
vestiges of a hearth or oven (plan, B). Building III (70 × 80 feet) is
that usually called the commandant's house; it seems to show the normal
plan of rooms arranged round a cloister enclosing a tiny open space. In
buildings II and III, at D, traces were detected as of ditches and
walling belonging to a fort older and probably smaller than that
revealed by the excavation generally.
</p>
<p>
Small finds include coins of Faustina Iunior, Iulia Domna, and Valens,
Samian of about A.D. 80 and later, including one or two bits of German
Samian, a silver spoon, some glass, iron, and bronze objects, a leaden
basin (?), and seven more leaden sling-bullets. It now seems clear that
the fort was established about the time of Agricola (A.D. 80-5), though
perhaps in smaller dimensions than those now visible, and was held till
at least A.D. 365. Mr. Collingwood inclines to the view that it was
abandoned after A.D. 85 and reoccupied under or about the time of
Hadrian. The stratification of the turrets

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>[12]</span>

  seems to show that it was destroyed once or twice in the second or third
centuries, but the evidence is not wholly clear in details. The
granaries seem to have been rebuilt once and the rooms of the
commandant's house mostly have two floors.
</p>
<p>
(ix) <i>Lancaster.</i> In October and November 1914, structural remains
thought to be Roman, including 'an old Roman fireplace, circular in
shape, with stone flues branching out', were noted in the garden of St.
Mary's vicarage. The real meaning of the find seems doubtful.
</p>
<p>
(x) <i>Ribchester.</i> In the spring of 1913 a small school-building was
pulled down at Ribchester, and the Manchester Classical Association was
able to resume its examination of the Principia (praetorium) of the
Roman fort, above a part of which this building had stood. The work was
carried out by Prof. W. B. Anderson, of Manchester University, and Mr.
D. Atkinson, Research Fellow of Reading College, and, though limited in
extent, was very successful.
</p>
<p>
The first discovery of the Principia is due to Miss Greenall, who about
1905 was building a house close to the school and took care that certain
remains found by her builders should be duly noted: excavations in
1906-7, however, left the size and extent of these remains somewhat
uncertain and resulted in what we now know to be an incorrect plan. The
work done last spring makes it plain (fig. 3) that the Principia
fronted&mdash;in normal fashion&mdash;the main street of the fort (gravel laid on
cobbles) running from the north to the south gate. But, abnormally, the
frontage was formed by a verandah or colonnade: the only parallel which
I can quote is from Caersws, where excavations in 1909 revealed a
similar verandah in front of the Principia<a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a>. Next to the verandah
stood the usual Outer Court with a colonnade round it and two wells in
it (one is the usual provision): the colonnade seemed to have been twice
rebuilt. Beyond that are fainter traces of the Inner Court which,
however, lies mostly underneath a churchyard: the only fairly clear
feature is a room (A on plan) which seems to have stood on the right
side of the Inner Court, as at Chesters and Ambleside (fig. 2, above).
Behind this, probably, stood the usual five office rooms. If we carry
the Principia about 20 feet further back, which would be a full
allowance for these rooms with their walling, the end of the whole
structure will line with the ends of the granaries found some years ago.
This, or something very like it, is what we should naturally expect. We
then obtain a structure

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>[13]</span>

measuring 81 × 112 feet, the latter dimension including a verandah 8
feet wide. This again seems a reasonable result. Ribchester was a large
fort, about 6 acres, garrisoned by cavalry; in a similar fort at
Chesters, on Hadrian's Wall, the Principia measured 85 × 125 feet: in
the 'North Camp' at Camelon, another fort of much the same size (nearly
6 acres), they measured 92 × 120 feet.

(xi) <i>Slack.</i> The excavation of the Roman fort at Slack, near
Huddersfield, noted in my report for 1913 (p. 14), was continued in 1914
by Mr. P. W. Dodd and Mr. A. M. Woodward, lecturers in Leeds University,
which is doing good work in the exploration of southern Yorkshire. The
defences of the fort, part of its central buildings (fig. 4, I-III), and
part of its other buildings (B-K) have now been attacked. The defences
consist of (1) a ditch 15 feet wide, possibly double on the north (more
exactly north-west) side and certainly absent on the southern two-thirds
of the east (north-east)

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>[14]</span>

  side; (2) a berme, 8 feet wide; and (3) a rampart 20-5 feet thick, built
of turf and strengthened by a rough stone base which is, however, only
8-10 feet wide. Of the four gates, three (west, north, and east) have
been examined; all are small and have wooden gate-posts instead of
masonry. On each side of the east gate, which is the widest (15 ft.),
the rampart is thought to thicken as if for greater defence. The absence
of a ditch on the southern two-thirds of the east side may be connected
with some paving outside the east gate and also with a bath-house,
partly explored in 1824 and 1865, outside the south-east (east) corner;
we may think that here was an annexe. The central buildings, so far as
uncovered, are of stone; the Principia (III) perhaps had some wooden
partitions. They are all ill-preserved and call for no further comment.
West of them, in the rear of the fort, the excavators traced two long
narrow wooden buildings (B, C), north of the road from the west
(south-west) gate to the back of the Principia; on the other side of the
road they found the ends of two similar buildings (D, E). This looks as
if this portion of the fort was filled with four barracks. On the other
side of the row of buildings I-III remains were traced of stone
structures; one of these (F) had the L-shape characteristic of barracks,
and indications point to two others (G, H) of the same shape. This
implies six barrack buildings in this portion of the fort and ten
barrack buildings in all, that is, a cohort 1,000 strong. But the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>[15]</span>

  whole fort is only just 3 acres, and one would expect a smaller
garrison; when excavations have advanced, we may perhaps find that the
garrison was really a <i>cohors quingenaria</i> with six barracks, as at
Gellygaer. Close against the east rampart, and indeed cutting somewhat
into it, was a long thin building (K), 12-16 feet wide, which yielded
much charcoal and potsherds and seemed an addition to the original plan
of the fort.

<p>
The few small finds included Samian of the late first and early second
centuries (but no '29'), and a denarius of Trajan. In respect of date,
they agree with the finds of last year and of 1865, and suggest that the
fort was established under Domitian or Trajan, and abandoned under
Hadrian or Pius; as an inscription of the Sixth Legion was found here in
1744, apparently in the baths, the evacuation cannot have been earlier
than about A.D. 130. The occupation of Slack must therefore have
resembled that of Castleshaw, which stands at the western end of the
pass through the Pennine Hills, which Slack guards on the east. If this
be so, an explanation must be discovered for two altars generally
assigned to Slack. One of these, found three miles north of Slack at
Greetland in 1597 among traces of buildings, is dated to A.D. 205 (CIL.
vii. 200). The other, found two miles eastwards, at Longwood, in 1880
(Eph. Epigr. vii. 920), bears no date; but it was erected by an Aurelius
Quintus to the Numina Augustorum, and neither item quite suits so early
a date as the reign of Trajan. The dedication of the first is to the
goddess Victoria&mdash;<i>Vic</i>(<i>toria</i>)
<i>Brig</i>(<i>antia</i>)&mdash;that of the second <i>deo Berganti</i> (as
well as the <i>Numina Aug.</i>); so that in each case a local shrine to
a native deity may be concerned. It is also possible that a fort was
built near Greetland, after the abandonment of Slack, to guard another
pass over the Pennine, that by way of Blackstone Edge.
</p>
<p>
It is to be hoped that these interesting excavations may be continued
and completed.
</p>
<p>
(xii) <i>Holt.</i> At Holt, eight miles south of Chester on the
Denbighshire bank of the Dee, Mr. Arthur Acton has further explored the
very interesting tile and pottery works of the Twentieth Legion, of
which I spoke in my Report for 1913 (p. 15). The site is not even yet
exhausted. But enough has been discovered to give a definite picture of
it, and as it may perhaps not be possible to continue the excavations at
present, and as the detailed report which Mr. Acton projects may take
time to issue, I shall try here, with his permission, to summarize very
briefly his most noteworthy results. I have to thank him for supplying
me with much information and material for illustrations.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>[16]</span>
</p>
<p>
Holt combines the advantages of excellent clay for pottery and tile
making,<a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> good building stone (the Bunter red sandstone), and an easy
waterway to Chester. Here the legion garrisoning Chester established, in
the latter part of the first century, tile and pottery works for its own
use and presumably also for the use of other neighbouring garrisons.
Traces of these works were noted early in the seventeenth century,
though they were not then properly understood.<a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> In 1905 the late Mr.
A. N. Palmer, of Wrexham, identified the site in two fields called Wall
Lock and Hilly Field, just outside the village of Holt, and here, since
1906, Mr. Acton has, at his own cost, carefully and systematically
carried out excavations.

<p>
The discoveries show a group of structures scattered along a bank about
a quarter of a mile in length which stands slightly above the Dee and
the often flooded meadows beside it (fig. 5). At the west end of this
area (fig. 5, no. 1, and fig. 6) was a large rectangular enclosure of
about 62 × 123 yards (rather over 1-1/2 acres), girt with a strong wall
7 feet thick. Within it were five various rows of rooms mostly 15 feet
square, with drains; some complicated masonry (? latrines) filled the
east end. This enclosure was not wholly explored; it may have served for
workmen's barracks; the contents of two rubbish-pits (fig. 6,
<span class="sc">aa</span>)&mdash;bones of edible animals, cherry-stones,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>[17]</span>

  shells of snails, and Dee mussels, potsherds, &amp;c.&mdash;had a domestic look;
mill-stones for grinding corn, including one bearing what seems to be a
centurial mark, and fragments of buff imported amphorae were also found
here. Between this enclosure and the river were two small buildings
close together (fig. 5, no. 2 and fig. 7). The easternmost of these
seems to have been a dwelling-house 92 feet long, with a corridor and
two hypocausts; it may have housed the officer in charge of the
potteries. The western building was a bath-house, with hot-rooms at the
east end, and the dressing-room, latrine, and cold-bath at the west end;
one side of this building was hewn into the solid rock to a height of 3
feet. Several fibulae were found in the drains of the bath-house.

<p>
The other structures (3, 4, 6, 7) served industrial purposes. No. 4
(fig. 5) contained a hypocaust and was perhaps a workroom and drying
shed. At 6 were ill-built and ill-preserved rooms, containing

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>[18]</span>

  puddled clay, potsherds, &amp;c., which declared them to be work-sheds of
some sort. Finally, at 3 and 5 we have the kilns. No. 3 was a kiln 17
feet square, with a double flue, used (as its contents showed) for
potting, and indeed for fine potting. No. 5 (figs. 8, 9) was an
elaborate 'plant' of eight kilns in an enclosure of about 55 × 140 feet.
Kilns A, B, F, H were used for pottery, C, D, E for tiles, F for both
large vessels and tiles; the circular kiln G seems to be a later
addition to the original plan. The kilns were thus grouped together for
economy in handling the raw and fired material and in stacking the fuel,
and also for economy of heat; the three tile-kilns in the centre would
be charged, fired, and drawn in turn, and the heat from them would keep
warm the smaller pottery-kilns round them. The interiors of the kilns
contained many broken and a few perfect pots and tiles; round them lay
an enormous mass of wood-ashes, broken tiles and pots, 'wasters' and the
like. The wood-ashes seem to be mainly oak, which abounds in the
neighbourhood of Holt. The kilns themselves are exceptionally
well-preserved. They must have been in actual working order, when
abandoned, and so they illustrate&mdash;perhaps better than any kilns as yet
uncovered and recorded in any Roman province&mdash;the actual mechanism of a
Roman tile- or pottery-kiln. The construction of a kiln floor, which
shall work effectively and accurately, is less simple than it looks; the
adjustment of the heat to the class of wares to be fired, the
distribution of the heat by

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>[19]</span>

proper flues and by vent-holes of the right size, and other such details
require knowledge and care. The remains at Holt show these features
admirably, and Mr. Acton has been able to examine them with the aid of
two of our best experts on pottery-making, Mr. Wm. and Mr. Joseph
Burton, of Manchester.

Smaller finds include two centurial stones (one found in 1914 is
described below, <a href="#page34">p. 34</a>); a mill-stone with letters suggesting that it
belonged to a century of soldiers; several <i>graffiti</i>, mostly of a
military character, so far as one can decipher them (for one see my
Report for 1913, p. 30); a profusion of stamped tiles of the Twentieth
Legion, mostly 'wasters'; some two dozen antefixes of the same legion;
several tile and pottery stamps; about 45 coins of various dates; much
window glass, and an immense quantity of potsherds of the most various
kinds. Among these latter were Samian pieces of the late first century
(no '29', but early '37' and '78' and a stamp of <span class="ss">CRESTO</span>) and of the
second century (including the German stamp <span class="ss">IANVF</span>), and imitation Samian
made on the spot. A quantity of lead and of iron perhaps worked into
nails, &amp;c., at Holt, and a few crucibles for casting small bronze
objects, may also be mentioned.
</p>
<p>
The Twentieth Legion tiles at Holt bear stamps identical with those on
its tiles at Chester; we may think that the legion made for itself at
Holt most of the tiles which it used in its fortress. Equal interest
and more novelty attaches to the pottery made at Holt. This comprises
many varieties; most prominent is a reddish or buff ware of excellent
character, coated with a fine slip, which occurs in many different forms
of vessels, cooking pots, jars, saucers, and even large flat dishes up
to 30 inches in diameter. Specimens of these occur also in Chester,
and it is clear that the legionary workmen made not only tiles&mdash;as in
legionary tile-works in other lands&mdash;but also pots, mortaria (fig. 1),
&amp;c., for legionary use.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most remarkable pieces among the pottery are some stamped
pieces copied from decorated Samian, which I am able to figure here by
Mr. Acton's kindness (figs. 1, 10, 11). They are pale reddish-brown in
colour and nearly as firm in texture as good Samian; they are made (he
tells me) by throwing on a wheel a clay (or 'body') prepared from local
materials, then impressing the stamps, and finally laying on an iron
oxide slip, perhaps with a brush. Sir Arthur Evans has pointed out to me
that the stamp used for the heads on fig. 1 was a gem set in a ring; the
setting is clearly visible under each head. The shape and ornament have
plainly been suggested by specimens of Samian '37' bowls, probably of
the second century. How far the author tried to copy definite pieces of
Samian and how far he aimed at

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>[20]</span>

  giving the general effect, is not quite clear to me. The large circles
on fig. 11 suggest the medallions of Lezoux potters like Cinnamus; the
palmettes might have been taken from German originals. Very few of these
interesting pieces were found&mdash;all of them close to the kiln numbered 3
on fig. 5.

Silenus in relief. It is believed to be the artist's die, from which the
potters' sunk dies would be cast; from such sunk dies little casts would
be made and 'applied' in relief to the outsides of the bowls, to the
handles of jugs, &amp;c. It does not seem to have been intended for any sort
of ware made from a mould; indeed, moulded ware rarely occurs among the
products of Holt. It is far finer work than most Samian ornamentation;
probably, however, it has never been damaged by use. It was found, with
one or two less remarkable dies, in the waste round kiln 3.
</p>
<p>
Interest attaches also to various vessels, two or three nearly perfect
and many broken, which have been glazed with green, brown or yellow
glaze; some of these pieces seem to be imitated from cut glass ware.
Along with them Mr. Acton has found the containing bowls (saggars)

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>[21]</span>

  and kiln-props used to protect and support the glazed vessels during the
process of firing, and as the drip of the glaze is visible on the sides
of the props and the bottoms of the saggars, he infers that the Holt
potters manufactured glazed ware with success.

It is obvious that Mr. Acton's detailed report on Holt will be full of
important matter, and that further excavation of the site, whenever it
may be possible, will also yield important results.
</p>
<p>
(xiii) <i>Cardiff.</i> The widening of Duke Street, which fronts the
eastern half of the south side of Cardiff Castle, has revealed the
south-east angle of the Roman fort, on the top of which the castle
stands, and has revealed it in good preservation. Nothing, however, has
come to light which seems to increase or alter our previous knowledge of
the fort. Many small Roman objects are stated to have been found, Samian
ware, coins, brooches, beads, in the course of the work; these may
belong to the 'civil settlement' which, as I have said elsewhere, may
have lain to the south of the fort (<i>Military Aspects of Roman
Wales</i>, p. 105). When they have been sorted and dated, they should
throw light on the history of Roman Cardiff.
</p>
<p>
(xiv) <i>Richborough.</i> This important site has been taken over by
H.M. Office of Works, and some digging has been done round the central
platform, but (Mr. Peers tells me) without any notable result. The
theory that this platform was the base of a lighthouse is still the most
probable.

<p>
(xv) <i>Wroxeter (Viroconium).</i> The systematic excavation of Wroxeter
begun in 1912 by Mr. J. P. Bushe-Fox on behalf of the London Society of
Antiquaries and the Shropshire Archaeological Society, was carried by
him through its third season in 1914. The area examined lay immediately
north of the temple uncovered in 1913. The main structure in it was a
large dwelling-house 115 feet long, with extensions up to 200 feet,
which possessed at least two courtyards, a small detached bath-house,
various mosaic and cement floors, hypocausts, and so forth. It had been
often altered, and its excavation and explanation were excessively
difficult. Mr. Bushe-Fox thinks that it may have begun as three shops
giving on to the north and south Street which bounds its eastern end.
Certainly it became, in course of time, a large corridor-house with a
south aspect and an eastern wing fronting the street, and as such it
underwent several changes in detail. Beyond its western end lay a still
more puzzling structure. An enceinte formed by two parallel walls, about
13 feet apart, enclosed a rectangular space of about 150 feet wide; the
western end

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>[22]</span>

  of it, and therefore its length, could not be ascertained; the two
corners uncovered at the east end were rounded; an entrance seems to
have passed through the north-east corner. It has been called a small
fort, an amphitheatre, a stadium, and several other things. But a fort
should be larger and would indeed be somewhat hard to account for at
this spot; while a stadium should have a rounded end and, if it was of
orthodox length, would have extended outside the town into or almost
into the Severn. Interest attaches to a water-channel along the main
(north and south) street. This was found to have at intervals slits in
each side which were plainly meant for sluice-gates to be let down; Mr.
Bushe-Fox thinks that the channel was a water-supply, and not an
outfall, and that by the sluice-gates the water was dammed up so as,
when needed, to flow along certain smaller channels into the private
houses which stood beside the road. If so, the discovery has much
interest; the arrangement is peculiar, but no other explanation seems
forthcoming.
</p>
<p>
Small finds were many and good. Mr. Bushe-Fox gathered 571 coins ranging
from three British and one or two Roman Republican issues, to three
early coins of the Emperor Arcadius, over 200 Samian potters' stamps,
and much Samian datable to the period about A.D. 75-130, with a few rare
pieces of the pre-Flavian age. There was a noticeable scarcity of both
Samian and coins of the post-Hadrianic, Antonine period; it was also
observed that recognizable 'stratified deposits' did not occur after the
age of Hadrian. Among individual objects attention is due to a small
seal-box, with wax for the seal actually remaining in it.
</p>
<p>
It appears that it will probably not be possible to continue this
excavation, even on a limited scale, next summer. Mr. Bushe-Fox's report
for 1913 is noticed below, <a href="#page52">p. 52</a>.
</p>
<p>
(xvi) <i>Lincoln.</i> At Lincoln an inscribed fragment found in 1906 has
now come to light. It bears only three letters, <span class="ss">IND</span>, being the last
letters of the inscription; these plainly preserve a part of the name of
the town, Lindum. See below, <a href="#page34">p. 34</a>.
</p>
<p>
(xvii) <i>Gloucester.</i> Here, in March 1914, a mosaic floor, 16 feet
square, with a complex geometrical pattern in red, white, and blue, has
been found 9 feet below the present surface, at 22 Northgate Street.
Some painted wall-plaster from the walls of the room to which it
belonged were found with it.
</p>
<p>
(xviii) Discoveries in <i>London</i> have been limited to two groups of
rubbish-pits in the City, (<i>a</i>) At the General Post Office the pits
opened in 1913 (see my Report, p. 22) were further carefully explored in
1914 by Mr. F. Lambert, Mr. Thos. Wilson, and Dr. Norman;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>[23]</span>

  the Post Office gave full facilities. Over 100 'potholes' were detected,
of which about forty yielded more or less datable rubbish, mainly
potsherds. Four contained objects of about A.D. 50-80, though not in
great quantity&mdash;four bits of decorated Samian and eight Samian
stamps&mdash;and fourteen contained objects of about A.D. 70-100; the rest
seemed to belong to the second century, with some few later items
intermixed. One would infer that a little rubbish was deposited here
before the Flavian period, but that after about A.D. 70 or 80 the site
was freely used as a rubbish-ground for three generations or more. Two
objects may be noted, a gold ring bearing the owner's initials Q.D.D.
and a bit of inscribed wood from the lining of a well or pit (<a href="#page35">p. 35</a>).
(<i>b</i>) At the top of King William Street, between Sherborne Lane and
Abchurch Lane, not so far from the Mansion House, five large pits were
opened in the summer of 1914, in the course of ordinary contractors'
building work. They could not be so minutely examined as the Post Office
pits, but it was possible to observe that their datable potsherds fell
roughly within the period A.D. 50-100, and that a good many potsherds
were earlier than the Flavian age; there must have been considerable
deposit of rubbish here before A.D. 70 or thereabouts, and it must have
ceased about the end of the century. A full account of both groups of
pits was given to the Society of Antiquaries by Mr. F. Lambert on
February 11, 1915; illustrated notices of the Post Office finds were
contributed by Mr. Thos. Wilson to the Post Office Magazine, <i>St.
Martin-le-Grand</i> (January and July, 1914); Mr. D. Atkinson helped
with the dating of the pottery.
</p>
<p>
Much gratitude is due to those who have so skilfully collaborated to
achieve these results. So far as it is permissible to argue from two
sites only, they seem to throw real light on the growth of the earliest
Roman London. The Post Office pits lie in the extreme north-west of the
later Londinium, just inside the walls; the King William Street pits
are in its eastern half, not far from the east bank of the now vanished
stream of Wallbrook, which roughly bisected the whole later extent of
the town. It may be assumed that, at the time when the two groups of
pits were in use, the inhabited area had not yet spread over their
sites, though it had come more or less close. That would imply that the
earliest city lay mainly, though perhaps not wholly, on the east bank
of Wallbrook; then, as the houses spread and the town west of Wallbrook
developed, the King William Street pits were closed, while the Post
Office pits came more into use, during and after the Flavian age.
</p>
<p>
This conclusion is tentative. It must be remembered that the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>[24]</span>

  stratification of rubbish-pits, ancient as well as modern, is often very
peculiar. It is liable to be confused by all sorts of cross-currents. In
particular, objects are constantly thrown into rubbish-pits many years,
perhaps even centuries, after those objects have passed out of use.
Whenever, even in a village, an old cottage is pulled down or a new one
built, old rubbish gets shifted to new places and mixed with rubbish of
a quite different age. At Caerwent, as Dr. T. Ashby once told me, a deep
rubbish-pit yielded a coin of about A.D. 85 at a third of the way down,
and at the very bottom a coin of about 315. That is, the pit was in use
about or after 315; some one then shovelled into it debris of much
earlier date. The London pits now in question are, however, fairly
uniform in their contents, and their evidence may be utilized at least
as a base for further inquiries.
</p>
<p>
(xix-xxii) <i>Rural dwellings.</i> Three Roman 'villas'&mdash;that is,
country-houses or farms&mdash;have been explored in 1914. All are small.

Fig. 12. Bath-house, East Grimstead

<p>
(xix) At <i>East Grimstead</i>, five miles south-east from Salisbury, on
Maypole Farm near Churchway Copse<a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a>, a bath-house has been dug out and
planned by Mr. Heywood Sumner, to whom I owe the following details. The
building (fig. 12) measures only 14 × 28 feet and contains only four
rooms, (1) a tile-paved apartment which probably served as entrance and
dressing-room, (2) a room over a pillared hypocaust, which may be called
the tepidarium, (3) a similar smaller room, nearer the furnace and
therefore perhaps hotter, which may be the caldarium&mdash;though really it
is hardly worth while to distinguish between these two rooms&mdash;and (4) a
semicircular bath, lined with pink mortar and fine cement, warmed with
flues from rooms 3 and with box-tiles, and provided with an outfall
drain; east of rooms 3 and 4 was the furnace. Small finds included
window glass, potsherds, two to three hundred oyster-shells, and five
Third Brass coins (two Constantinian, three illegible). Large stone
foundations

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>[25]</span>

  have been detected close by; presumably this was the detached bath-house
for a substantial residence which awaits excavation. Such detached
bath-houses are common; I may instance one found in 1845 at Wheatley
(Oxon.), which had very similar internal arrangements and stood near a
substantial dwelling-house not yet explored (<i>Archaeol. Journal</i>,
ii. 350). A full description of the Grimstead bath, by Mr. Sumner, is in
the press.
</p>
<p>
(xx) Three miles south-west of Guildford, at Limnerslease in the parish
of <i>Compton</i>, Mr. Mill Stephenson has helped to uncover a house
measuring 53 × 76 feet, with front and back corridors, and seven
rooms, including baths. Coins suggested that it was inhabited in the
early fourth century&mdash;a period when our evidence shows that many
Romano-British farms and country-houses were occupied.<a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a>

<p>
(xxi) A third house is supplied by Kent. This was found in June about
six miles south of Gravesend, near the track from <i>North Ash</i> to
Ash Church, on the farm of Mr. Geo. Day. Woodland was being cleared for
an orchard, flint foundations were encountered, and the site was then
explored by Mr. Jas. Kirk, Mr. S. Priest, and others of the Dartford
Antiquarian Society, to whom I am indebted for information: the Society
will in due course issue a full Report. The spade (fig. 13) revealed a
rectangular walled enclosure of 53 × 104 feet. The entrance was at
the east end; the dwelling-rooms (including a sunk bath, 7 feet square,
lined with plaster) were, so far as traced, in the west and south-west
portion; much of the walled space may have been farmyard or wooden
sheds. Many bits of Samian and other pottery were found (among them a
mortarium stamped <span class="ss">MARTINVSF</span>), and many oyster-shells. Other
Romano-British foundations have been suspected close by.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>[26]</span>
</p>

<p>
The structure somewhat resembles the type of farm-house which might
fairly be called, from its best-known example&mdash;the only one now
uncovered to view&mdash;the Carisbrooke type.<a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> That, however, usually has
rooms at both ends, as in the Clanville example which I figure here as
more perfect than the Carisbrooke one (fig. 14). One might compare the
buildings at Castlefield, Finkley, and Holbury, which I have discussed
in the <i>Victoria History of Hants</i> (i. 302-3, 312), and which were
perhaps rudimentary forms of the Carisbrooke type.

</div>

<p>
(xxii) A few kindred items may be grouped here. Digging has been
attempted in a Roman 'villa' at Litlington (Cambs.) but, as Prof.
McKenny Hughes tells me, with little success. The 'beautifully tiled
and marbled floors' are newspaper exaggeration. A 'Roman bath' which
was stated to have been found early in 1914 at Kingston-on-Thames,
in the work of widening the bridge, is declared by Mr. Mill Stephenson
not to be Roman at all. Lastly, an excavation of an undoubted Roman
house at Broom Farm, between Hambledon and Soberton in south-east Hants,
projected by Mr. A. Moray Williams, was prevented by the war, which
called Mr. Williams to serve his country.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>[27]</span>
</p>

<p>
(xxiii) <i>Lowbury.</i> During the early summer of 1914 Mr. D. Atkinson
completed his examination of the interesting site of Lowbury, high amid
the east Berkshire Downs. Of the results which he won in 1913 I gave
some account last year (Report for 1913, p. 22); those of 1914 confirm
and develop them. We may, then, accept the site as, at first and during
the Middle Empire, a summer farm or herdsmen's shelter, and in the
latest Roman days a refuge from invading English. Whether the wall which
he traced round the little place was reared to keep in cattle or to keep
out foes, is not clear; possibly enough, it served both uses. In all,
Mr. Atkinson gathered about 850 coins belonging to all periods of the
Empire but especially to the latest fourth century and including
Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius. He also found over fifty brooches
and a great amount of pottery&mdash;3 cwt., he tells me&mdash;which was mostly
rough ware: there was little Samian (some of shape '37'), less Castor,
and hardly any traces of mortaria. A notable find was the skeleton of
a woman of 50 (ht. about 5 feet 9 inches), which he discovered in the
trench dug to receive the foundations of the enclosing wall; it lay in
the line of the foundations amidst the perished cement of the wall, and
its associations and position forbid us to think either that it was
buried before the wall was thought of or was inserted after the wall was
ruined. Mr. Atkinson formed the theory&mdash;with natural hesitation&mdash;that
it might be a foundation burial, and I understand that Sir Jas. Frazer
accepts this suggestion. A full report of the whole work will shortly
be issued in the Reading College Research Series.
</p>
<p>
(xxiv) <i>Eastbourne, Beachy Head.</i> The Rev. W. Budgen, of
Eastbourne, tells me of a hoard of 540 coins found in 1914 in a coombe
near Bullock Down, just behind Beachy Head. The coins range from
Valerian (1 coin) to Quintillus (4 coins) and Probus (1 coin); 69 are
attributed to Gallienus, 88 to Victorinus, 197 to the Tetrici, and 40 to
Claudius Gothicus ; the hoard may have been buried about A.D. 280, but
it has to be added that 130 coins have not been yet identified. Hoards
of somewhat this date are exceedingly common; in 1901 I published
accounts of two such hoards detected, shortly before that, at points
quite close to the findspot of the present hoard (see <i>Sussex
Archaeological Collections</i>, xliv, pp. 1-8).
</p>
<p>
Mr. Budgen has also sent me photographs of some early cinerary urns and
a 'Gaulish' fibula, found together in Eastbourne in 1914. The things may
belong to the middle of the first century A.D. The 'Gaulish' type of
fibula has been discussed and figured by Sir Arthur Evans
(<i>Archaeologia</i>, lv. 188-9, fig. 10; see also Dressel's note in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>[28]</span>

  <i>Bonner Jahrbücher</i>, lxiv. 82). Its home appears to be Gaul. In
Britain it occurs rather infrequently; east of the Rhine it is still
rarer; it shows only one vestige of itself at Haltern and is wholly
absent from Hofheim and the Saalburg. Its date appears to be the first
century A.D., and perhaps rather the earlier two-thirds than the end of
that period.
</p>
<p>
(xxv) <i>Parc-y-Meirch</i> (<i>North Wales</i>). Here Mr. Willoughby
Gardner has further continued his valuable excavations (Report for 1913,
p. 25). The new coin-finds seem to hint that the later fourth-century
stratum may have been occupied earlier in that century than the date
which I gave last year, A.D. 340. But the siege of this hill-fort is
bound to be long and its full results will not be clear till the end.
Then we may expect it to throw real light on an obscure corner of the
history of Roman and also post-Roman Wales.

<h2>
    B. ROMAN INSCRIPTIONS FOUND IN BRITAIN IN 1914
</h2>
<p>
This section includes the Roman inscriptions which have been found, or
(perhaps I should say) first recognized to exist, in Britain in 1914 or
which have become more accurately known in that year. As in 1913, the
list is short and its items are not of great importance; but the
Chesterholm altar (No. 5) deserves note, and the Corbridge tile also
possesses considerable interest.
</p>
<p>
I have edited them in the usual manner, first stating the origin,
character, &amp;c., of the inscription, then giving its text with a
rendering in English, thirdly adding any needful notes and acknowledging
obligations to those who may have communicated the items to me. In the
expansions of the text, square brackets denote letters which, owing to
breakage or other cause, are not now on the stone, though one may
presume that they were originally there; round brackets denote
expansions of Roman abbreviations. The inscriptions are printed in the
same order as the finds in section A, that is, from north to
south&mdash;though with so few items the order hardly matters.
</p>
<p>
(1) Found at Balmuildy (above, <a href="#page7">p. 7</a>) in the annexe to the south-east of
the fort proper, some sandstone fragments from the top of a small altar,
originally perhaps about 14 inches wide. At the top, in a semicircular
panel is a rude head; below are letters from the first two lines of the
dedication; probably the first line had originally four letters:&mdash;

</div>

<p>
Possibly <span class="ss">DIO</span> may be for <i>deo</i>. It is by no means a common
orthography, but if it be accepted, we can read <i>dio [s(ancto)
Ma]rti</i>.... The reading <span class="ss">DIIO</span>, <i>deo</i>, is I fear impossible.

I have to thank Mr. S. N. Miller, the excavator, for photographs.

</p>

<p>
(2) At Traprain Law (above, <a href="#page8">p. 8</a>) a small potsherd from a second-century
level bore the letters scratched on it
</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="images/ill-030a.png" alt="I R I /" /></div>

<p>
These letters were on the side of the potsherd which had formed the
inner surface when the pot was whole; they must therefore have been
inscribed after the pot had been smashed, and the size and shape of the
bit give cause to think that it may have been broken intentionally for
inscription&mdash;possibly for use in some game. In any case, it must have
been inscribed at Traprain Law, and not brought there already written,
and the occurrence of writing of any sort on such a site is noteworthy.
</p>
<p>
I am indebted to Dr. G. Macdonald for a sight of the piece.
</p>
<p>
(3) Found about three and a half miles north of the Roman fort
Bremenium, High Rochester, near Horsley in north Northumberland, beside
the Roman road over the Cheviots (Dere Street), close to the steading of
Featherwood, in the autumn of 1914, now in the porch of Horsley Parish
Church, a plain altar 51 inches high by 22 inches wide, with six lines
of letters 2 inches tall. The inscription is unusually illegible. Only
the first and last lines are readable with certainty; elsewhere some
letters can be read or guessed, but not so as to yield coherent sense.

<p>
The altar was dedicated to Victory; nothing else is certain. It is
tempting to conjecture in line 2 <span class="ss">ET N AVG</span>, <i>et numinibus
Augustorum</i>, as on some other altars to Victory, but <span class="ss">ET</span> is
not certain, though probable, and <span class="ss">N AVG</span> is definitely
improbable. The fourth line seems to have been intentionally erased. I
find no sign of any mention of the Cohors I Vardullorum, which
garrisoned Bremenium, though it or its commander might naturally be
concerned in putting up such an altar.
</p>
<p>
We may assume that the altar belongs to Bremenium; possibly it was
brought thence when Featherwood was built.

<p>
I have to thank the Rev. Thos. Stephens, vicar of Horsley, for
photographs and an excellent squeeze and readings, and Mr. R. Blair for
a photograph.

(4-5) Found on July 17, 1914, at Chesterholm, just south of Hadrian's
Wall, lying immediately underneath the surface in a grass field 120
yards west of the fort, two altars:
</p>
<p>
(4) 32 inches tall, 15 inches broad, illegible save for the first line
</p>

<p>
<i>I(ovi) o(ptimo) m(aximo)</i>....
</p>
<p>
(5) 34 inches tall, 22 inches broad, with 8 lines of rather irregular
letters, not quite legible at the end (fig. 16).

<p>
<i>Pro domu divina et numinibus Augustorum, Volcano sacrum, vicani
Vindolandesses, cu[r(am)] agente ... v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens)
m(erito)</i>.
</p>
<p>
'For the Divine (i.e. Imperial) House and the Divinity of the Emperors,
dedicated to Vulcan by the members of the <i>vicus</i> of Vindolanda,
under the care of ... (name illegible).'
</p>
<p>
The statement of the reason for the dedication given in the first three
lines is strictly tautologous, the Divine House and the Divinity

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>[32]</span>

  of the Emperors being practically the same thing. The formula
<i>numinibus Aug.</i> is very common in Britain, though somewhat rare
elsewhere; in other provinces its place is supplied by the formula <i>in
honorem domus divinae</i>; it belongs mostly to the late second and
third centuries. The plural <i>Augustorum</i> does not appear to refer
to a plurality of reigning Emperors, but to the whole body of Emperors
dead and living who were worshipped in the Cult of the Emperors.
</p>
<p>
The <i>vicani Vindolandesses</i> are the members of the
settlement&mdash;women and children, traders, old soldiers, and others&mdash;which
grew up outside the fort at Chesterholm, as outside nearly all Roman
forts and fortresses. In this case they formed a small self-governing
community, presumably with its own 'parish council', which could be
called by the Roman term <i>vicus</i>, even if it was not all that a
proper <i>vicus</i> should be. This altar was put up at the vote of
their 'parish meeting' and paid for, one imagines, out of their common
funds. The term <i>vicus</i> is applied to similar settlements outside
forts on the German Limes; thus we have the <i>vicani Murrenses</i> at
the fort of Benningen on the Murr (CIL. xiii. 6454) and the <i>vicus
Aurelius</i> or <i>Aurelianus</i> at Oehringen (ibid. 6541).
</p>
<p>
<i>Vindolandesses</i>, which is merely a phonetic spelling or
misspelling of <i>Vindolandenses</i>, gives the correct name of the
fort. In the Notitia it is spelt Vindolana, in the Ravennas (431. 11)
Vindolanda; and as in general the Ravennas teems with errors and the
Notitia is fairly correct, the spelling Vindolana has always been
preferred, although (as Prof. Sir John Rhys tells me) its second part
<i>-lana</i> is an etymological puzzle. It now appears that in this, as
in some few other cases, the Ravennas has kept the true tradition. The
termination <i>-landa</i> is a Celtic word denoting a small defined
space, akin to the Welsh 'llan', and also to the English 'land'; I
cannot, however, find any other example in which it forms part of a
place-name of Roman date. <i>Vindo-</i> is connected either with the
adjective <i>vindos</i>, 'white', or with the personal name Vindos
derived from that adjective.
</p>
<p>
I have to thank Mrs. Clayton, the owner of Chesterholm, and her foreman,
Mr. T. Hepple, for excellent photographs and squeezes. The altars are
now in the Chesters Museum.
</p>
<p>
(6) Found at Corbridge, in August 1914, fragment of a tile, 7 × 8 inches
in size, on which, before it was baked hard, some one had scratched
three lines of lettering about 1-1-1/2 inches tall; the surviving
letters form the beginnings of the lines of which the ends are broken
off. There were never more than three lines, apparently.
</p>
<p>

<div class="figure"><img src="images/ill-038a.png" alt="O M Q L   LIIND/  LEGEFEL" /></div>

<p>
The inscription seems to have been a reading lesson. First the teacher
scratched two lines of letters, in no particular order and making no
particular sense; then he added the exhortation <i>lege feliciter</i>,
'read and good luck to you'. A modern teacher, even though he taught by
the aid of a slate in lieu of a soft tile, might have expressed himself
less gracefully. The tile may be compared with the well-known tile from
Silchester, on which Maunde Thompson detected a writing lesson (Eph.
Epigr. ix. 1293). A knowledge of reading and writing does not seem to
have been at all uncommon in Roman Britain or in the Roman world
generally, even among the working classes; I may refer to my
<i>Romanization of Roman Britain</i> (ed. 3, pp. 29-34).
</p>
<p>
The imperfectly preserved letter after <span class="ss">Q</span> in line 1 was perhaps
an angular <span class="ss">L</span> or <span class="ss">E</span>; that after <span class="ss">D</span>, in line 2,
may have been <span class="ss">M</span> or <span class="ss">N</span> or even <span class="ss">A</span>.
</p>
<p>
I am indebted to Mr. R. H. Forster for a photograph and squeeze of the
tile.
</p>
<p>
(7) Found in a peat-bog in Upper Weardale, in August 1913, two bronze
skillets or 'paterae', of the usual saucepan shape, the larger weighing
15-1/2 oz., the smaller 8-1/2 oz. Each bore a stamp on the handle; the
smaller had also a graffito on the rim of the bottom made by a
succession of little dots. An uninscribed bronze ladle was found with
the 'paterae':
</p>

<p>
The stamps of the Campanian bronze-worker Cipius Polybius are well
known. Upwards of forty have been found, rather curiously distributed
(in the main) between Pompeii and places on or near the Rhenish and
Danubian frontiers, in northern Britain, and in German and Danish lands
outside the Roman Empire. The stamped 'paterae' of other Cipii and other
bronze-workers have a somewhat similar distribution; it seems that the
objects were made in the first century A.D., in or near Pompeii, and
were chiefly exported to or beyond the borders of the Empire. Their
exact use is still uncertain, I have discussed them in the
<i>Archaeological Journal</i>, xlix, 1892, pp. 228-31; they have since
been treated more fully by H. Willers (<i>Bronzeeimer von Hemmoor</i>,
1901, p. 213, and <i>Neue Untersuchungen über die römische
Bronzeindustrie</i>, 1907, p. 69).

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>[34]</span>
</p>
<p>
I have to thank Mr. W. M. Egglestone, of Stanhope, for information and
for rubbings of the stamps. The <span class="ss">E</span> in the first stamp seems
clear on the rubbing; all other examples have here <span class="ss">I·</span> or
<span class="ss">I</span>. In the second stamp, the conclusion might be <span class="ss">BI·F</span>.
The <i>graffito</i> was first read <span class="ss">INVINDA</span>; it is, however,
certainly as given above.
</p>
<p>
(8) Found at Holt, eight miles south of Chester (see above, <a href="#page15">p. 15</a>), in
the autumn of 1914, built upside down into the outer wall of a kiln, a
centurial stone of the usual size and character, 10 inches long, 7-8
inches high, with letters (3/4-1 inch tall) inside a rude label
</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="images/ill-039a.png" alt="cCESo NIANA" /></div>

<p>
<i>c(enturia) C(a)esoniana</i>, set up by the century under Caesonius.
</p>
<p>
Like another centurial stone found some time ago at Holt (Eph. Epigr.
ix. 1035), this was not found <i>in situ</i>; the kiln or other
structure into the wall of which it was originally inserted must have
been pulled down and its stones used up again.
</p>
<p>
The centuries mentioned would of course be units from the Twentieth
Legion at Chester.
</p>
<p>
(9) Found at Holt late in 1914, a fragment of tile (about 7 × 7
inches) with parts of two (or three) lines of writing scratched on it.
</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="images/ill-039b.png" alt="...LIVITILI.. ..IT TAL.. ........." /></div>

<p>
I can offer no guess at the sense of this. The third line may be mere
scratches. I am indebted to Mr. Arthur Acton for sending Nos. 8 and 9 to
me for examination.
</p>
<p>
(10) Found at Lincoln in 1906, on the site of the Technical Schools
extensions (outside the east wall of the lower Roman town), a fragment
from the lower right-hand corner of an inscribed slab flanked with
foliation, 13 inches tall, 19 inches wide, with 2-inch lettering.
</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="images/ill-039c.png" alt="G IND fol- iat- ion" /></div>

<p>
No doubt one should prefix <span class="ss">L</span> to <span class="ss">IND</span>. That is, the inscription ended with
some part of the Romano-British name of Lincoln, Lindum, or of its
adjective Lindensis. From the findspot it seems probable that the
inscription may have been sepulchral.
</p>
<p>
I am indebted to Mr. Arthur Smith, Curator of the City and County Museum
at Lincoln, for a squeeze. The stone is now in the Museum.

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>[35]</span>
</p>

<p>
(11) Found in London near the General Post Office in a rubbish-pit (see
above, <a href="#page23">p. 23</a>), two pieces of wood from the staves of a barrel which
seems to have served as lining to a pit or well. They bear faint
impressions of a metal stamp; (<i>a</i>) is repeated twice.
</p>



<p class="quote">
    (<i>a</i>) <img src="images/ill-040a.png" alt="TEC.PAGA" /> <i>and</i> <img src="images/ill-040b.png" alt="..C·PA..&#8224;" />

<p class="quote">
    (<i>b</i>) <img src="images/ill-040c.png" alt="CS" /> <i>or</i> <img src="images/ill-040d.png" alt="CB" />
</p>
<p>
The first stamp seems to include a name in the genitive, perhaps
<i>Pacati</i>, but I do not know what <span class="ss">TEC</span> means.
</p>
<p>
(12) Found in another rubbish-pit of the same site as No. 11, a plain
gold ring with three sunk letters on the bezel:
</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="images/ill-040e.png" alt="Q . D . D" /></div>

<p>
Presumably the initials of an owner. The letters were at first read
<span class="ss">O·D·D</span>, but the tail of the Q is discernible.
</p>
<p>
I am indebted to the Post Office authorities and to Mr. F. Lambert for a
sight of Nos. 11 and 12. The objects are preserved at the General Post
Office.
</p>
<p>
(13) I add here a note on a Roman milestone found in 1694 near Appleby
and lately refound.
</p>
<p>
Among the papers of the antiquary Richard Gough in the Bodleian
Library&mdash;more exactly, in his copy of Horsley's <i>Britannia</i>, gen.
top. 128 = MS. 17653, fol. 44 <i>v.</i>&mdash;is recorded the text of a
milestone of the Emperor Philip and his son, 'dug out of ye military
way 1694, now at Hangingshaw'. The entry is written in Gough's own hand
on the last page of a list of Roman and other inscriptions once
belonging to Reginald Bainbridge, who was schoolmaster in Appleby in
Elizabeth's reign and died there in 1606.<a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> This list had been drawn up
by one Hayton, under-schoolmaster at Appleby, in 1722 and had been
copied out by Gough. There is, however, nothing to show whether the
milestone, found eighty-eight years after the death of Bainbridge and
plainly none of his collection, was added by Hayton, or was otherwise
obtained by Gough and copied by him on a casually blank page; there is
nothing even to connect either the stone or Hangingshaw with Appleby.
</p>
<p>
The notice lay neglected till Hübner undertook to edit the Roman
inscriptions of Britain, which he issued in the seventh volume of the
<i>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</i> in 1873. He included the milestone
as No. 1179. But, with his too frequent carelessness&mdash;a carelessness
which makes the seventh volume of the <i>Corpus</i> far less valuable
than the rest of the series&mdash;he christened the stone, in defiance of
dates,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>[36]</span>

  No. 17 in Bainbridge's collection; he also added the statement (which
we shall see to be wrong) that Hangingshaw was near Old Carlisle.
Fortunately, in the autumn of 1914, Mr. Percival Ross, the Yorkshire
archaeologist, sent me a photograph of an inscription which he
had come upon, built into the wall of a farm called Hangingshaw,
about 200 yards from the Roman road which runs along the high
ground a little east of Appleby. It then became plain&mdash;despite
Hübner's errors&mdash;that this stone was that recorded in Gough's
papers, although his copy was in one point faulty and on the other
hand some letters which were visible in 1694 have now apparently
perished. A rubbing sent me by the late Rev. A. Warren of Old
Appleby helped further; I now give from the three sources&mdash;Gough's
copy, the photograph, and the rubbing&mdash;what I hope may be a fairly
accurate text. I premise that the letters <span class="ss">RCO</span> in line 2, <span class="ss">LIPPO</span> in 3,
<span class="ss">PHILIPPO</span> in 8, <span class="ss">IMO</span> in 9, and <span class="ss">I</span> in 10 seem to be no longer visible
but depend on Gough's copy.

<p>
The chief fault in Gough's copy is the omission of line 6,
<i>Augusto</i>. This misled Hübner into treating line 7 (<span class="ss">ERP</span>)
as a blundered reading of that necessary word. In reality, line 7 is the
most interesting item in the inscription. It shows that the Emperor
Philip was, here at least, styled <i>perpetuus Augustus</i>. That is an
appellation to which I find no exact parallel in Philip's other
inscriptions or indeed in any other imperial inscriptions till half a
century after his death. It fits, however, into a definite development
of the Roman imperial titles. In the earliest Empire, phrases occur,
mostly on coins, such as <i>Aeternitas imperii</i> or <i>Aeternitas
populi romani</i>. Soon the notion of the stability of the Empire was
transferred to its rulers. As early as Vespasian, coins bear the legend
<i>aeternitas Augusti</i>, and in the first years of the second century
Pliny, writing to Trajan, speaks of petitions addressed <i>per salutem
tuam aeternitatemque</i> and of 'works worthy of the emperor's
eternity,'

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>[37]</span>

  (<i>opera aeternitate tua digna</i>). Late in the second century such
phrases become commoner. With Severus Alexander (A.D. 221-35) coins
begin to show the legend <i>Perpetuitas Aug.</i>, and before very long
the indirect and abstract language changes into direct epithets which
are incorporated in the emperors' titulature. The first case which I can
find of this is that before us, of Philip (A.D. 244-9); a little later,
Aurelian (A.D. 270-5) is styled <i>semper Augustus</i> and, from
Diocletian onwards, <i>aeternus</i>, <i>perpetuus</i>, and <i>semper
Augustus</i> belong to the customary titulature. Constantine I, for
example, is called on one stone <i>invictus et perpetuus ... semper
Augustus</i>, on another <i>perpetuus imperator, semper Augustus</i>.
That Philip should have been the first to have applied to him, even
once, the direct epithet, is probably a mere accident. One might have
wished to connect it with his Secular Games, celebrated in 248. But by
that time his son was no longer Caesar but full Augustus (since 246),
and our stone must fall into the years 244-6.
</p>
<p>
The ideas underlying these epithets were perhaps mixed. Notions of or
prayers for the long life of the Empire, the stability of the reigning
house, the long reign of the current emperor, may have jostled with
notions of the immortality of the emperors and their deification, and
with the eastern ideas which poured into Rome as the second century
ended and the third century began.<a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> The hardening despotism of the
imperial constitution, growing more and more autocratic every decade,
also helped. As the emperor became unchecked and unqualified monarch,
his appellations grew more emphatic; <i>perpetuus Augustus, semper
Augustus</i> connoted that unchecked and autocratic rule.

<h2>
    C. PUBLICATIONS RELATING TO ROMAN BRITAIN IN 1914
</h2>
<p>
The following summary of the books and articles on Roman Britain which
appeared in 1914 is grouped under two heads, first, those few which deal
with general aspects of the subject, and secondly, the far larger number
which concern special sites or areas. In this second class, those which
belong to England are placed under their counties in alphabetical order,
while those which belong to Wales and Scotland are grouped under these
two headings. I have in general admitted only matter which was published
in 1914, or which bears that date.
</p>

<h3>
1. <span class="sc">General</span>
</h3>

<p>
<a name="para1" id="para1"></a>
(1) Mr. G. L. Cheesman's <i>Auxilia of the Roman Imperial Army</i>
(Oxford University Press) does not deal especially with Roman Britain,
but it deserves brief notice here. It is an excellent and up-to-date
sketch of an important section of the Roman army, with which British
archaeologists are much concerned. It also contains valuable lists,
which can be found nowhere else, of the 'auxiliary' regiments stationed
in Britain (pp. 146-9 and 170-1). It is full, cheap, compact; every
historical and archaeological library should get it.
</p>
<p>
<a name="para2" id="para2"></a>
(2) A learned and scholarly attempt to settle the obscure chronology of
the north British frontiers in the fourth century has been made by Mr.
H. Craster, Fellow of All Souls, and one of the excavators of Corbridge,
in the <i>Archaeological Journal</i> (lxxi. 25-44). His conclusions are
novel and, though to some extent disputable, are well worth printing.
Starting from the known fact that, during much of the third century, the
north frontier of Roman Britain coincided roughly with the line of
Cheviot and was then withdrawn to the line of Hadrian's Wall, he
distinguishes five stages in the subsequent history. (1) At or just
before the outset of the fourth century, in the reign of Diocletian, the
Wall was reorganized in some ill-recorded fashion. (2) Thirty years
later, towards the end of Constantine's reign, about A.D. 320-30, it was
(he thinks) further reorganized; perhaps its mile-castles were then
discarded. (3) Thirty or forty years later still,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>[39]</span>

after disturbances which (he conjectures) included the temporary loss of
Hadrian's Wall and the destruction of its garrisons, Theodosius carried
out in 369 a fuller reorganization. This garrison had consisted of the
regiments known to us by various evidence as posted 'per lineam valli'
in the third and early fourth centuries; their places were now filled by
soldiers of whom we know absolutely nothing. (4) In 383 Maximus withdrew
these unknown troops for his continental wars. Now perhaps the line of
the Wall had to be given up, but Tyne and Solway, South Shields,
Corbridge, and Carlisle were still held. (5) Finally, about 395-9,
Stilicho ordered a last reorganization; he withdrew the frontier from
the Tyne to the Tees, from Carlisle to Lancaster, and garrisoned the new
line with new soldiery&mdash;those, namely, which are listed in the Notitia
as serving under the Dux Britanniarum, save only the regiments 'per
lineam valli'; these last the compiler of the Notitia borrowed from the
older order to disguise the loss of the Wall. Even this did not last. In
402 Stilicho had to summon troops to Italy for home defence&mdash;among them,
Mr. Craster suggests, the Sixth Legion&mdash;and in 407 the remaining Roman
soldiers, including the Second Legion, were taken to the continent by
Constantine III.
</p>
<p>
Every one who handles this difficult period must indulge in conjecture;
Mr. Craster has, perhaps, indulged rather much. It might be simpler to
connect the abandonment of the mile-castles&mdash;his stage 2&mdash;with the
recorded troubles which called Constans to Britain in 343, rather than
invent an unrecorded action by Constantine I. I hesitate also to assume
for the period 369-83 an otherwise unknown frontier garrison, which has
left no trace of itself. I feel still greater doubt respecting the years
383-99. Here Mr. Craster argues from coin-finds. No coins have been
found on the line of the Wall which were minted later than 383, and none
at Corbridge, Carlisle, and South Shields which were minted later than
395; therefore, he infers, the Wall was abandoned soon after 383, and
the other sites soon after 395. This is too rigid an argument. It may be
a mere accident that the Wall has as yet yielded no coin which was
minted between 383 and 395. At Wroxeter, for example, two small hoards
were found some years ago which had clearly been lost at the moment when
the town was sacked. By these hoards we should be able to date the
catastrophe. Now the latest coin in one hoard was minted in or before
377, and the latest in the other in or before 383. But newer finds show
that Wroxeter was not destroyed at earliest till after 390. Again, as
Mr. Craster himself says, the coining of Roman copper practically
stopped in 395; after that year the older copper

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>[40]</span>

  issues appear to have remained in use for many a long day. That is clear
in Gaul, where coins later than 395 seem to be rare, although Roman
armies and influences were present for another fifty years. When Mr.
Craster states that 'archaeology gives no support to the theory that the
Tyne-Solway line was held after 395', he might add that it gives equally
little support to the theory that it was not held after 395.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, he offers a new theory of the two chapters in the Notitia
Dignitatum which describe the forces commanded by the Comes Litoris
Saxonici and the Dux Britanniarum (<i>Occ.</i> 28 and 40). It is agreed
that these chapters do not exhibit the garrison of Britain at the moment
when the Notitia was substantially completed, about A.D. 425, for the
good reason that there was then no garrison left in the island; they
exhibit some garrison which had then ceased to exist, and which is
mentioned, apparently, to disguise the loss of the province. The
question is, to what date do they refer? Mommsen long ago pointed out
that the regiments enumerated in one part of them (the 'per lineam
valli' section) are very much the same as existed in the third century.
Seeck added the suggestion that these regiments remained in garrison
till 383, when Maximus marched them off to the continent. According to
him, the garrison of the Wall through the first eighty years of the
fourth century was much the same as it had been in the third century,
with certain changes and additions. Mr. Craster holds a different view.
He thinks that most of the troops named in these chapters were due to
Stilicho's reorganization in 395-9, but that one section, headed 'per
lineam valli', records troops who had been in Britain in the third
century and had been destroyed before 369. I cannot feel that he has
proved his case. One would have thought that, when the compiler of the
Notitia in 425 wanted to fill the gap left by the loss of the Wall, he
would have gone back to the last garrison of the Wall, that is, on Mr.
Craster's view, the garrison of 369-83, not to arrangements which had
vanished some years earlier. But the problems of this obscure period are
not to be solved without many attacks. We must be glad that Mr. Craster
has delivered a serious attack; even if he has not succeeded, his

Britain. It also prints a note by myself (p. 439) on the topography of
the campaign of Suetonius against Boudicca, which argues that the defeat

(4) In the <i>Sitzungsberichte der kgl. preuss. Akademie</i> (1914, p.

of St. Patrick, commonly spelt Sucat and explained as akin to Celtic
words meaning 'brave in war' (stem <i>su</i>-, 'good'), ought to be
really spelt Succet and connected with Gaulish names like Succius and
Sucelus. This, he thinks, destroys the last remnant of a reason for
Zimmer's idea that Patrick was the same as Palladius.

thirty-five graves found in 1912-3 in the Infirmary Field, Chester, of
which I gave a brief account in my Report for 1913 (p. 14). Save for a
few first-century remains in one corner, the graveyard seems to be an
inhumation cemetery, used during the second half of the second
century&mdash;rather an early date for such a cemetery. I do not myself feel
much doubt that some at least of the tombstones extracted in 1890-2 from
the western half of the North City Wall were taken from this area. They
belong to the first and second centuries and suggest (as I pointed out
when they were found) that the Wall was built about A.D. 200. That,
however, is just the date when the cemetery was closed; the seizure of
the tombstones for the construction of the Wall would explain why the
Infirmary Field has yielded no tombstones from all its graves. By the

<i>Derbyshire</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="para7" id="para7"></a>
(7) A list of the place-names of Derbyshire with philological notes is
commenced by Mr. B. Walker, sometime of Liverpool University, in the
<i>Proceedings of the Derbyshire Archaeological and Natural History
Society</i> for 1913 (xxxvi. 123-284, Derby, 1914); it is to be
completed in a future volume. I venture two suggestions. First, like,
many similar treatises on place-names which are now being issued, this
work has too limited a scope. It deals mainly with certain names of
modern towns and villages; it takes little or no heed of ancient names
of houses and fields or of lanes and roads (as Bathamgate, Doctorgate),
or of rivers (as Noe), or (lastly) of the place-names of the older
England which are preserved only in charters, chronicles, and the like;
unless they chance to come among the select list of modern names which
the writer chooses to admit, they find no notice. Yet it is the older
names of all sorts, irrespective of their survival in prominent fashion
to-day, with which historical students and even philologists are most
really concerned. Secondly, writers on place-names take too little
account of facts outside the phonetic horizon. In the present instalment
of Derbyshire, the one Roman item noted is Derby. Here, in the suburb of
Little Chester, was a Roman fort or village, and past it flows the river
then and now called Derwent or something similar. Yet the etymology of
Derby is discussed without any reference to the river name. No doubt
Derby is not derived by regular phonetic process from Derwent; its
earliest spellings, Deoraby and the like, connect it with either the
word for 'wild beast' or the proper name Deor. Still, it is incredible
that the Derwent should flow past Derby and the adjacent Darley
(formerly Derley) and be unrelated. One may guess with little rashness
that the invaders who renamed the site took over the Romano-British name
(Deruentio or the like) and reshaped that after analogies of their own
speech. Does not a form Deorwenta occur (though Mr. Walker has missed
it) to show that the two names interacted? Again, Chesterfield
(Cesterfelda, A.D. 955) is glossed as 'the field by the fort'. What
fort? There is none, nor does 'Chester' necessarily mean that there was.
Etymologizing without reference to facts is wasted work.

Mr. E. B. Francis dug into a similar mound and met with many potsherds
of Roman date and a coin of Domitian; no trace of a burial was detected,
such as has come to light in other Romano-British mounds at Mersea,
Bartlow, and elsewhere (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 224). Indeed, it does not seem
quite clear that the mound was thrown up in Roman times; it may have
been reared later, with earth which contained Romano-British objects.

followed near Greenwich. Its course is quite clear as far west as the
outskirts of Greenwich; thence it is doubtful all the way to London. In
these papers evidence is advanced that a piece of road was closed in the
lower part of Greenwich Park in 1434 and it is suggested that this was a
bit of the lost Roman line. If so, the road ran straight on from
Shooter's Hill, across Greenwich Park and the site of the Hospital
School, towards the mouth of Deptford Creek. It is, however, hard to see
how it crossed that obstacle, or why it should have run so near the
Thames at this point, where the shore must have been very marshy.

to our knowledge of the line of the road; he directs

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>[46]</span>

  attention rather to the reasons for the course which the road pursues,
its diversions from the straight line, and its gradients. He notes also,
as others have noted, the absence of any intermediate fort half-way
along the twenty-seven miles. Probably there was such a fort; but it
must have stood in the wildest part of the road, almost in the heart of
the Forest of Bowland and perhaps somewhere in Croasdale, and it has
never been detected. The greater ease of the lowland route from
Ribchester by Lancaster to Overborough may have led to the early
abandonment of the shorter mountain track and of any post which guarded
its central portion. That, at any rate, is the suggestion which I would
offer to Lancashire antiquaries as a working hypothesis.

<i>London</i>
</p>
<p>
<a name="para23" id="para23"></a>
(23) In his new volume <i>London</i> (London, 1914) Sir L. Gomme
continues his efforts to prove that English London can trace direct and
uninterrupted descent from Roman Londinium. Though, he says (p. 9),
'Roman civilization certainly ceased in Britain with the Anglo-Saxon
conquest, ... amidst the wreckage London was able to continue its use of
the Roman city constitution in its new position as an English city'. I
can only record my conviction that not all his generous enthusiasm
provides proof that Roman London survived the coming of the English. The
root-error in his arguments is perhaps a failure to realize the Roman
side of the argument. He says, for instance, that, though not a
'colonia', Londinium had the rank of 'municipium civium Romanorum'.
There is not the least reason to think that it was a 'municipium'. So
again, his references to a 'botontinus' on Hampstead Heath (p. 86), to
the 'jurisdictional

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>[47]</span>

  terminus' of Roman London at Mile End (p. 95), to its 'pomerium' (p.
98), its right of forming commercial alliances with other cities, which
'lasted into the Middle Ages and is a direct survival of the system
adopted in Roman towns' (p. 101), its position as a 'city-state' and its
relation to the choice of Emperors (pp. 105, 130)&mdash;all this has nothing
to do with the real Londinium; these things did not exist in the Roman
town. When Sir Laurence goes on to assert that 'the ritual of St. Paul's
down to the seventeenth century preserved the actual rites of the
worship of Diana', he again falls short of proof. What part of the
ritual and what rites of Diana?<a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
</p>
<p>
<a name="para24" id="para24"></a>
(24) In the December number of the <i>Journal of the British
Archaeological Association</i> (xx. 307) Mr. F. Lambert, of the
Guildhall Museum, prints pertinent criticisms of Sir L. Gomme's volume,
much in the direction of my preceding paragraphs. He also makes useful
observations on Roman London. In particular, he attacks the difficult
problem of the date when its town-walls were built. Here he agrees with
those who ascribe them to the second century, and for two main reasons.
First, he thinks that the occurrence of early Roman potsherds at certain
points near the walls proves the town to have grown to its full extent
by about A.D. 100. Secondly, he points to the foundations of the Roman
gate at Newgate; as they are shallower than those of the adjacent
town-walls, he dates the gate after the walls and thus obtains (as he
hopes) an early date for the walls. Both points were worth raising, but
I doubt if either proves Mr. Lambert's case. For (<i>a</i>) the
potsherds come mostly from groups of rubbish-pits&mdash;such as those which
Mr. Lambert himself has lately done good work in helping to explore&mdash;and
rubbish-pits, especially in groups, lie rather outside the inhabited
areas of towns. Those of London itself suggest to me that the place had
<i>not</i> reached its full area by A.D. 100 (see above, <a href="#page23">p. 23</a>).
(<i>b</i>) The Newgate foundations are harder to unravel. As a rule,
Roman town-gates had large super-structures and needed stronger
foundations than the town-walls. At Newgate, where the superstructure
must have been comparatively slender, the published plans show that
under a part, at least, of the gate-towers the undisturbed subsoil rises
higher than beneath the adjacent town-walls. According to the elevation
published by Dr. Norman and Mr. F. W. Reader in <i>Archaeologia</i>
lxiii, plate lvii, the wall-builders at this point stopped their deep
foundation trenches

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>[48]</span>

  for the full width of the gateway (98 feet), or at least dug them
shallower there. No motive for such action could be conceived except the
wish to leave a passage for a gate. There would seem, therefore, to have
been an entrance into Roman London at Newgate as early as the building
of the walls, and there may have been such an entrance even before the
erection of these walls. Dr. Norman has, however, warned me that plate
lvii goes much beyond the actual evidence (see plate lvi); practically,
we do not know enough to form conjectures of any value on this point.

<p>
<a name="para25" id="para25"></a>
(25) In the <i>Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects</i>
for April 11, 1914 (xxi. 333), Mr. W. R. Davidge prints a lecture on the
Development of London which deals mostly with present and future London
but also contains a new theory as to the Roman town. Hitherto, most
writers have agreed that, while Londinium may have been laid out on a
regular town-plan, no discoverable trace of such plan survived, nor
could any existing street be said to run to any serious extent on Roman
lines. Mr. Davidge devises a rectangular plan of oblong blocks, and
finds vestiges of Roman streets in the present Cheapside, Cannon Street,
Gracechurch Street, and Birchin Lane. In a later number of the same
journal (Aug. 29, p. 52) I have given some reasons for not accepting
this view. First, Mr. Davidge's list of four survivals would be too
brief to prove much if the survivals were proved. Secondly, Roman
structural remains seem to have been found under all the streets in
question, and it is, therefore, plain that they do not run on the lines
of Roman thoroughfares. Thirdly, his suggested plan brings none of his
conjectured Roman streets (except one) to any of the various known gates
of Londinium; it requires us to assume a number of other gates for which
there is neither probability nor proof.

fourth-century <i>Litus Saxonicum</i>. His account, which is not very
technical, seems based on previous writers, Ives, Harrod, Fox. I note

  a list of thirty coins which, save for an uncertain specimen of Domitian
and one of Marcus, belong entirely to the late third and the fourth
centuries, and end with two silver of Honorius (<i>Virtus Romanorum</i>,
Cohen 59). He detects a Roman road running east from Burgh Castle
towards Gorleston, preserved (he thinks) in an old road sometimes called
the Jews' Way; this, however, seems unlikely. He also maintains the
view, which others have held, that the fort had no defences towards the
water. This again seems unlikely. Burgh Castle, like Richborough,
Stutfall, and other forts of the <i>Litus</i>, may well have had
different arrangements on its water-front from the walls on its other
three faces. But it cannot have lacked defences, and excavations prove,
here as elsewhere, that walls did actually exist on this side.

<a name="para28" id="para28"></a>
(28) A paper by the present writer and Prof. P. Gardner, entitled 'Roman
silver in Northumberland' (<i>Journal of Roman Studies</i>, iv. 1-12),
discusses the relics of what was seemingly a hoard&mdash;or perhaps a
service&mdash;of Roman silver plate, lost in the Tyne or on its banks near
Corbridge in the fourth century. Of five pieces, four were picked up
between 1731 and 1736, about 100-150 yards below the present bridge at
Corbridge; a fifth was found in 1760 floating in the stream four miles
lower down. One was a silver 'basin', of which no more is recorded.
Another was a small two-handled cup with figures of men and beasts round
it. A third was a round flat-bottomed bowl, with a decorated rim bearing
the Chi-Rho amidst its other ornament. A fourth was a small ovoid cup, 4
inches high, with the inscription <i>Desideri vivas</i>. Last, not
least, is the Corbridge Lanx, the only surviving piece of the five, and
probably the finest piece of Roman engraved silver found in these
islands, an oblong dish measuring 15 × 19 inches, weighing 148
ounces, and ornamented with figures of deities from classical mythology.
That all five pieces belonged together can hardly be doubted, though it
cannot be proved outright. That they all belong to the later Roman
period, and probably to the fourth century, seems highly probable.
Whether they were buried in the river-bank to conceal them from raiders
or were lost from a boat or otherwise, is not now discoverable. But the
occurrence of such silver close to the Roman Wall is in itself notable.
It is to be attributed rather to a Roman officer residing in or passing
through Corbridge than to either a Romanized Briton or a Pictish looter.
</p>
<p>
Apart from its findspot, the Lanx is important for its excellent

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>[50]</span>

  art and for the place which it seems to hold in the history of later
Greek art. It is, of course, not Romano-British work; it is purely Greek
in all its details and no doubt of Greek workmanship. The deities
figured on it have long been a puzzle. They are evidently classical
deities; three of them, indeed, are Apollo, Artemis, and Athena. But the
identity of the other two figures and the meaning of the whole scene
have been much disputed. Roger Gale, the first to attempt its
unravelment, suggested in 1735 that it was 'just an assemblage of
deities', and at one time I inclined to this view&mdash;that we had here
merely (let us say) a tea-party at Apollo's; Dr. Drexel, too, wrote to
me lately to express the same idea. But I must confess that nearly all
the best archaeologists demand a definite mythological identification,
and my colleague, Prof. Gardner, suggests a new view&mdash;that the scene is
the so-called Judgement of Paris. This mythological incident was often
depicted in ancient art, and&mdash;strange as it may sound&mdash;in the later
versions Paris was not seldom omitted, Apollo was made arbiter, and the
scene was removed from Mount Ida to Delphi.<a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> The two hitherto
disputable figures are, Prof. Gardner thinks, Hera (seated) and
Aphrodite (standing, with a long sceptre). He ascribes the work to the
third or early part of the fourth century, and believes that it was made
in the Eastern Empire; from the prominence granted to Artemis, he
conjectures that Ephesus may have been its origin. But he adds that he
would not be sure that the artist of the piece, while copying a
Judgement of Paris, was consciously aware of the meaning of the original
before him. His views will be published in fuller detail in the
<i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>.
</p>
<p>
I am glad, further, to have been able to illustrate this paper by what I
believe to be a better illustration of the Lanx than has been published
before, and also to set out in more accurate fashion the curious legal
history of the object after it was found.

Northumberland County History Committee in vol. x (edited by Mr. H. H.
Craster, Newcastle, 1914, pp. 455-522) I have given a long account of
the known Roman remains in Corbridge parish. These are the settlement of
Corstopitum, a small stretch of Roman road and another of the Roman
Wall, and the fort of Halton (Hunnum) on the Wall. The account is
necessarily historical rather than archaeological; it tries to sum up
the finds and estimate their historical bearing, and it also catalogues
all the inscribed and sculptured stones found at Corbridge and Halton,
with the 'literature' relating to

279-310); see also a short account by myself in the <i>Proceedings of
the Society of Antiquaries of London</i> (xxvi. 185-9). The discoveries
were comparatively few; they comprised some ill-preserved and mostly
insignificant buildings on the north side of the site, some ditches, and
a stretch of the road leading to the north (Dere Street). Among small
objects were an interesting but imperfect altar to 'Panthea ...', a
bronze 'balsamarium' showing a puzzling variety of barbarian's head,
and another piece of the Corbridge grey <i>appliqué</i> ware. A short
account of the excavations of 1914 (see above, <a href="#page9">p. 9</a>) is contained in the

(32) About ten miles east from Nottingham, and a mile south of the

usually been identified with the Margidunum of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>[52]</span>

  Antonine Itinerary. Lately excavation has been attempted, and the
<i>Antiquary</i> of December 1914 contains an interesting account of the
results attained up to the end of 1913, with some illustrations.<a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> A
very broad earthwork and ditch surround an area of 7 acres, rhomboidal
in shape (fig. 23). In this area the excavators, Drs. Felix Oswald and
T. D. Pryce, have turned up floor-tesserae, roof-slates, flue-tiles,
window-glass, painted wall-plaster, potsherds of the first and later
centuries, including a black bowl with a well-modelled figure of Mercury
in relief, coins ranging down to the end of the fourth century
(Eugenius), and other small objects of interest, such as the small
seal-box with Late-Celtic enamel, shown in fig. 24. No foundations <i>in
situ </i>have yet come to light, but that is doubtless to follow; only a
tiny part of the whole area has, as yet, been touched. Margidunum may
have begun as a fort coeval with the Fosse-way, which (if I am right)
dates from the earliest years of the Roman Conquest. Whether any of the
first-century potsherds as yet found there can be assigned to these
years (say A.D. 45-75) is not clear. But the excavations plainly deserve
to be continued.

(33) Mr. Bushe-Fox's second Report on his excavations at Wroxeter
(<i>Reports of the Research Committee of the London Society of
Antiquaries</i>, No. II, Oxford, 1914) deserves all the praise accorded
to his first Report. I can only repeat what I said of that; it is an
excellent description, full and careful, minute in its account of the
smaller finds, lavishly illustrated, admirably printed, and sold for
half a crown. The finds which it enumerates in detail I summarized in my
Report for 1913, pp. 19-20&mdash;the temple with its interesting Italian
plan, the fragments of sculpture which seem to belong to it, the crowd
of small objects, the masses of Samian (indefatigably recorded), the 528
coins; all combine to make up an admirable pamphlet.
</p>
<p>
I will venture a suggestion on the temple. This, as I pointed out last
year, is on the Italian, not on the Celto-Roman plan. But one item is
not quite clear in it. All ordinary classical temples stood on
<i>podia</i> or platforms which raised them above the surrounding
surface at least to some small extent. Mr. Bushe-Fox speaks of a
<i>podium</i> to the Wroxeter temple. But it appears that he does not
mean a <i>podium</i>, as generally understood. The masonry which he
denotes by that term was, in his opinion, buried underground and merely
foundation.

  The floor of the portico of the temple (he says) was about level with
the floor of the court which surrounded the temple; the floor of the
<i>cella</i>, though higher, was but a trifle higher (see figs. 26, 27).
This view needs more reflection than he has given it in his rather brief
account. No doubt a temple in a Celtic land might have been built on a
classical plan, though without a classical <i>podium</i>. But it is not
what one would most expect. Nor do I feel sure that it was actually done
at Wroxeter in this case. The walls which Mr. Bushe-Fox explains as the
foundations of the temple are quite needlessly good masonry for
foundations never meant to be seen; this will be plain from figs. 27,
28, which I reproduce by permission from his Report. Further, as fig. 26
(from the same source) shows, there was outside the base of this masonry
a level cobbled surface, for which no structural reason is to be found.
This, one may guess, was a pavement at the original ground-level when
the temple was first erected; from this, steps presumably led up to the
floor of the portico and <i>cella</i>. The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>[54]</span>

  'podium', then, was at first a real <i>podium</i>. Later, the
ground-level rose, and the walls of the <i>podium</i> were buried.

(34) In his handsome volume, <i>Wookey Hole, its caves and
cave-dwellers</i> (London, 1914), Mr. H. E. Balch collects for general
antiquarian readers the results of his long exploration of this Mendip
cave; some of these results were noted in my Report for 1913, p. 47. The
cave, as a whole, contained&mdash;besides copious prehistoric remains&mdash;two
well-defined Roman layers, with many potsherds, including a little
Samian and one Samian stamp given as <span class="ss">PIIR PIIT OFII</span> (apparently
a new variety of Perpetuus), broken glass, a few fibulae and other
bronze and iron objects, and 106 coins. These coins are:&mdash;1 Republican
(124-103 B.C., Marcia), 1 Vespasian, 1 Titus, 1 Trajan, 2 Hadrian, 2
Pius; then, 3 Gallienus, 1 Salonina, 1 Carausius, 2 Chlorus, 1 Theodora,
6 Constantinopolis, 1 Crispus, 4 Constantine II, 4 Magnentius, 4
Constantius II, with 20 Valentinian I, 14 Valens, 21 Gratian, 7
Valentinian II, and 6 illegible. Just two-thirds of the coins are later
than A.D. 364; they may be set beside the late hoard found at Wookey
Hole in 1852, which Mr. Balch might well have mentioned. Plainly, the
later Roman layer in the cave belongs to the end of the fourth century.
The date of the other layer is harder to fix, since we are not told how
the coins and potsherds were distributed between the layers. Probably
the cave was long inhabited casually but in the troubled time of the
latest Empire became a place of refuge or otherwise attracted more
numerous occupants. That, if true, is a more interesting result that Mr.
Balch realizes. For in general the cave-life of Roman Britain belonged
to the first two or three centuries of our era; it is only rarely, and
mostly in the west country, that the caves contain among their Roman
relics objects of the late fourth century (see <i>Victoria Hist.
Derbyshire</i>, i. 233-42). I must add that Mr. Balch repeats on pp.
57-8 the error about the significance of the Republican coin which was
noted in my Report for 1915.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>[55]</span>

  <i>Queries for Somerset and Dorset</i> (xiv. 1914). (<i>a</i>) Skinner
in 1818 excavated a 'villa' near Camerton which he recorded in his
manuscripts. (British Mus. Add. 33659, &amp;c.) and which I described in
print in the <i>Victoria History of Somerset</i> (i. 315). His account
did not, however, enable one to fix the precise site; he said only that
it stood south of a certain Ridgeway and next to a field called
Chessils. Mr. E. J. Holmroyd has now, with the aid of tithe maps,
discovered a field called Chessils in the north of Midsomer Norton
parish, about a mile east of Paulton village, at the point where a lane
called in the Ordnance Survey 'Coldharbour Lane', which runs north and
south, cuts a lane running east and west from Camerton to Paulton; this
latter lane keeps to high ground and must be Skinner's Ridgeway. In
Chessils and in adjoining fields called Cornwell, just 525 feet above
sea-level, he has, further, actually found Roman potsherds, tiles, and
rough tesserae. This, as he says (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, xiv. 5, and
in a letter to me) will be the site of Skinner's 'villa.' (<i>b</i>) In
the same publication (p. 122) I have pointed out that the Parish Award
(1798) of Chedzoy, near Bridgwater, contains a field-name Chesters.
This, as the Rector of Chedzoy attests, is still in use there, as the
name of an orchard on the Manor Farm, just west of Chedzoy village.
According to older statements, a hypocaust was long ago found in
'Slapeland', and Slapeland too lies west of Chedzoy village (see
<i>Vict. Hist. Somerset</i>, i. 359). Two bits of slender evidence seem
thus to confirm each other, although no actual Roman remains have been
noted at Chedzoy lately.

often been taken for some kind of potteries, and are so explained by Mr.
Bulleid; many of these mounds were excavated about a hundred years ago,
and Mr. Bulleid has now dug into others. His results are not very
conclusive, but they seem to imply that the mounds, whatever they were,
were not used for pottery making, since among many relics of various
sorts no 'wasters' have been found. See further, for an account of the

(40) A Roman well has been examined near Ham Farm, between Hassocks
railway station and Hurstpierpoint. It was 38 feet deep, the upper part
round and lined with local blue clay, the lower part square and lined
with stout oak planks. The only object recorded from it is a 'first
century vase', taken out at half-way down, which suggests that the well
collapsed at an early date. Another well, flint-lined, was noted near
but not explored; Roman potsherds were picked up not far off (<i>Sussex
Archaeological Collections</i>, lvi. 197). The remains probably belong
to a farm detected close by in 1857 (<i>S. A. C.</i> xiv. 178). Traces

(48) The excavation of the Roman fort at Gellygaer, thirteen miles north
of Cardiff, was brought in 1913 to a point at which (as I learn) it is
considered to be for the present finished. I referred to it in my Report
for 1913; Mr. John Ward's full description of the results obtained in
1913 is now issued in the <i>Transactions of the Cardiff Naturalists'
Society</i> (vol. xlvi). The principal finds were a supposed
'drill-ground' on the north-east of the fort, a bit of another
inscription of Trajan, a kiln in the churchyard, and a largish earthwork
on the north-west of the fort. This last is a regular oblong of not
quite five acres internal area, fortified by an earthen mound and a
ditch; trenching across the interior showed no trace of buildings or
indeed of any occupation, but the search was not carried very far.
Several explanations have been offered of it&mdash;that it was a temporary
affair, thrown up while the actual fort was abuilding; that it was
intended for troops marching past and needing to camp for a night at the
spot; that it was an earlier fort, begun when the first invasion of the
Silures was made, about A.D. 50-2, but never finished. This third view
is Mr. Ward's own. Without more excavation, it is rash to pronounce
positively, and perhaps even a minute search might be fruitless.
Analogies somewhat favour the first theory, but there will always be
room for difference of opinion in explaining these excrescences (so to

explored.

As the exploration of this site appears to be closed for the present,
and indeed is nearly complete, it may be convenient to give a conspectus
of the whole in a small plan (fig. 29).

(<i>Inventory of Ancient Monuments in the County of Denbigh</i>, H.M.
Stationery Office, 1914) enumerates the few Roman remains of
Denbighshire. The one important item is the group of tile and pottery
kilns lately excavated by Mr. A. Acton at Holt, eight miles

  south of Chester, which I have described above (<a href="#page15">p. 15</a>); the
Commissioners' plan of the site seems to have an incorrect scale. Chance
finds, important if not yet fully understood, have been found in British
camps at Pen-y-corddin, Moel Fenlli, Moel y Gaer, and especially at
Parc-y-Meirch or Dinorben (above, <a href="#page28">p. 28</a>). Isolated coins have been found
scantily&mdash;a hoard of perhaps 6,000 Constantinian copper at Moel Fenlli,
a gold coin of Nero from the same hill, another coin of Nero at
Llanarmon, 200-300 Constantinian at Llanelidan. A parcel of bronze
'cooking vessels' was found near Abergele (Eph. Epigr. iii. 130) but has
unfortunately disappeared. The index also mentions coins under 'No.
458', which does not appear in the volume itself. A Roman road probably
ran across the county from St. Asaph to Caerhyn (Canovium); its east end
is pretty certain, as far as Glascoed, though the 'Inventory' hardly
makes this clear.

(51) The fifth Report of the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical
Monuments in Scotland, <i>Inventory of Monuments in Galloway. II.
Stewartry of Kirkcudbright</i> (Edinburgh, 1914) shows that the eastern
half of Galloway, like the western half described in the fourth Report
in 1912, contains nothing that can be called a 'Roman site' and very few
Roman remains of any sort. Indeed this eastern half, the land between
Dumfries and Newton Stewart, seems even poorer in such remains than the
district between Newton Stewart and the Irish Sea. Its only items are
some trifles of Samian, &amp;c., found in the Borness Cave, and some iron
implements found in a bronze caldron in Carlingwark Loch. This result
is, of course, contrary to the views of older Scottish writers like
Skene, who talked of 'numerous Roman camps and stations' in Galloway,
but it will surprise no recent student. Probably the Romans never got
far west of a line roughly coinciding with that of the Caledonian
Railway from Carlisle by Carstairs to Glasgow. Their failure or omission
to hold the south-west weakened the left flank and rear of their
position on the Wall of Pius and helped materially to shorten their
dominion in Scotland in the second century.

(52) In the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>
for 1913-4 (vol. xlviii) Mr. J. M. Corrie describes some polishers and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>[61]</span>

  other small objects found casually at Newstead (p. 338), and Dr.
Macdonald expands (p. 395) the account of the Balcreggan hoard which he
had contributed to the <i>Scotsman</i> (my Report for 1913, p. 11). Mr.
A. O. Curle (p. 161) records the discovery and exploration of a
vitrified fort at the Mote of Mark near Dalbeattie (Kirkcudbright), and
the discovery in it of two clearly Roman potsherds. The main body of the
finds made here seem to belong to the ninth century; whether any of them
can be earlier than has been thought, I am not competent to decide.
</p>
<p>
<a name="para53" id="para53"></a>
(53) The well-known and remarkable earthworks at Birrenswark, near
Lockerbie in Dumfriesshire, have long been explained as a Roman
circumvallation<a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> or at least as siege-works round a native hill-fort.
In 1913 they were visited by Prof. Schulten, of Erlangen, the excavator
of a Roman circumvallation round the Spanish fortress of Numantia; they
naturally interested him, and he has now described them for German
readers (<i>Neue Jahrbücher für das klassische Altertum</i>, xxxiii,
1914, pp. 607-17) and added some remarks on their date. His description
is clear and readable; his chronological arguments are less
satisfactory. He adopts<a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> the view generally adopted by English
archaeologists (except Roy) for the last two centuries, that these camps
date from Agricola; he supports this old conclusion by reasons which are
in part novel. I may summarize his position thus: Two Roman roads led
from the Tyne and the Solway to Caledonia, an eastern road by Corbridge
and Newstead, and a western one by Annandale and Upper Clydesdale. On
the eastern road, a little north of Newstead, is the camp of
Channelkirk; on the western are the three camps of Torwood Moor (near
Lockerbie), Tassie's Holm (north of Moffat), and Cleghorn in Clydesdale,
near Carstairs. These four camps are&mdash;so far as preserved&mdash;of the same
size, 1,250 × 1,800 feet; they all have six gates (two in each of the
longer sides); they all have traverses in front of the gates; lastly,
Torwood Moor is fourteen Roman miles, a day's march, from Tassie's Holm,
and that is twenty-eight miles from Cleghorn. Plainly they belong to the
same date. Further, Agricola is the only Roman general who used both
eastern and western routes together; accordingly, these camps date from
him. Finally, as Birrenswark is near Torwood Moor, it too must be
Agricolan.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>[62]</span>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Schulten has not advanced matters by this speculation. His first
point, that the four camps are coeval, and his reasons for that idea,
are mainly taken from Roy&mdash;he does not make this clear in his paper. But
he has not heeded Roy's warnings that the reasons are not cogent.
Actually, they are very weak. At Channelkirk, only two sides of a camp
remained in Roy's time; they measured not 1,250 × 1,800 feet but
1,330 × 1,660 feet, and the longer side had one gate in the middle,
not two; to-day, next to nothing is visible. At Tassie's Holm there was
only a corner of a perhaps quite small earthwork&mdash;not necessarily
Roman&mdash;and the distance to Torwood Moor is nearer twenty than fourteen
Roman miles. At Torwood Moor only one side, 1,780 feet long with two
gates, was clear in Roy's time; the width of the camp is unknown.
Cleghorn seems to have been fairly complete, but modern measurers give
its size as 1,000 × 1,700 feet. Dr. Schulten builds on imaginary
foundations when he calls these four camps coeval. He has not even proof
that there were four camps.
</p>
<p>
Nor is his reason any more convincing for assigning these camps, and
Birrenswark with them, to Agricola. Here he parts company from Roy and
adduces an argument of his own&mdash;that Agricola was the only general who
used both eastern and western routes. That is a mere assertion, unproven
and improbable. Roman generals were operating in Scotland in the reigns
of Pius and Marcus (A.D. 140-80) and Septimius Severus; if there were
two routes, it is merely arbitrary to limit these men to the eastern
route. As a matter of fact, the history of the western route is rather
obscure; doubts have been thrown on its very existence north of Birrens.
But if it did exist, the sites most obviously connected with it are the
second-century sites of Birrens, Lyne, and Carstairs; at Birrenswark
itself the only definitely datable finds, four coins, include two issues
of Trajan.<a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The truth is that the question is more complex than Dr. Schulten has
realized. Possibly it is not ripe for solution. I have myself ventured,
in previous publications, to date Birrenswark to Agricola&mdash;for reasons
quite different from those of Dr. Schulten. But I would emphasize that
we need, both there and at many earth-camps, full

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>[63]</span>

  archaeological use of the spade. The circumstances of the hour are
unfavourable to that altogether.

(54) As I go to press, I receive the <i>Transactions of the Woolhope
Naturalists' Field Club</i> for 1908-11 (Hereford, 1914), a volume
which, despite the date on its title-page, does not appear to have been
actually issued till April 1915. It contains on pp. 68-73 and 105-9 two
illustrated papers on three Roman roads of Herefordshire&mdash;Stone Street,
the puzzling road near Leominster, and Blackwardine, the itinerary route
between Gloucester and Monmouth. The find made at Donnington in 1906,
which is explained on p. 69 as a 'villa' and on p. 109 as an
agrimensorial pit&mdash;this latter an impossibility&mdash;was, I think, really a
kiln, though there may have been a dwelling-house near. The most
interesting of the Roman finds made lately in Herefordshire, those of
Kenchester, do not come into this volume, but belong in point of date to
the volume which will succeed it.

It is proper to add a warning that the traces of the

and Birrenswark. But though the Soc. Antiq. Minutes only describe the
coins as 'found in a Roman camp in Annandale, ... the first Roman camp
to be seen in Scotland', Gordon obviously knew more than the Minutes
contain&mdash;he gives, e.g. the name of a local antiquary who noted the
find&mdash;and the distinction between the 'town' (as it was then thought) of
Middelby (as it was then called) and the camp of Burnswork, was well
recognized in his time.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
